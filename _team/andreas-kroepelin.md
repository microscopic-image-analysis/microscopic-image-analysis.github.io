I am a PhD student with background in bioinformatics, scientific computing, and
data science working on computational structural biology.

My PhD project is part of the [Collaborative Research Center 1456: "Mathematics
of Experiment"](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/630785.html) and associated with
the initiative [Interactive Inference](https://inference.uni-jena.de/) by the
Faculty of Maths and Computer Science at Uni Jena.

The goal is to find methods of inference that allow us to use cryo-EM images of
protein samples to understand not only the static spatial structure of this
protein but also its conformational movements.
It's just like with a human hand: Its 3D-structure (with five separated fingers,
for example) is surely very important for its usability.
But understanding what a hand is actually capable of requires to consider how it
can change its form.

The main obstacle for this kind of inference is that we lose all information
about _when_ a molecule takes a certain shape, all we can hope to (directly)
reconstruct is the shape itself.
One central idea for this project is that Bayesian approaches can mitigate the
lack of information in the data.
This, in turn, requires finding good probabilistic models of protein structure
and conformational change.
