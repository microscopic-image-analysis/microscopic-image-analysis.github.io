In early March 2025 I finished my PhD in mathematics on the topic of slice sampling, for which I was jointly supervised by [Michael Habeck](/team/michael-habeck.html) and [Daniel Rudolf](https://staff.fim.uni-passau.de/~rudolf/) and associated to both the [Interactive Inference](https://inference.uni-jena.de/) project and the [Collaborative Research Center 1456 *Mathematics of Experiment*](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/628179.html). Subsequently, I am now carrying on my scientific work as a PostDoc, where I continue working on some remaining projects relating to slice sampling while also delving into some new topics.
