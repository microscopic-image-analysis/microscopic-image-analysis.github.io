I am a second-year PhD student in mathematics under joint supervision of [Michael Habeck](/microscopic-image-analysis.github.io/team/michael-habeck.md) and [Daniel Rudolf](https://staff.fim.uni-passau.de/~rudolf/).  

My PhD project is focused on slice sampling, which is a class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for approximate sampling from probability distributions on Euclidean spaces that have probability densities w.r.t. the Lebesgue measure. On the one hand, we are interested in improving the theoretical understanding of these methods, for example by deriving better estimates of their spectral gap (which quantifies both the convergence speed and the asymptotic sample quality of MCMC methods). On the other hand, we are looking into ways to improve the sampling methodology itself, e.g. by taking a theoretically motivated slice sampler and modifying it in such a way that it becomes efficiently implementable.
