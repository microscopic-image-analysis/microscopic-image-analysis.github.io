Coming from a background in RNA structure bioinformatics, I have been previously
interested in designing sequences with secondary structures similar to those of known
self-replicating RNA molecules.

For my PhD, I am applying Bayesian methods to 3D structure determination, taking into account the hierarchical nature
of nucleic acid structure.
