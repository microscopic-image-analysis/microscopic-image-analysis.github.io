My projects are at an intersection of applying bayesian modeling techniques to applications of computational imaging such as Ptychography. These projects are mainly driven by our group's focus on bayesian modeling and my interest in applying these techniques to problems in optics. Morever, I am also involved with development of new 3D-2D registration methods in Cryo-EM and X-ray nanotomography.
