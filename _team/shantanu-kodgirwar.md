My projects lie at the intersection of applying Bayesian modeling techniques to computational microscopy, including Cryo-EM and coherent diffractive imaging (CDI)—mainly ptychography. Driven by our group’s focus on Bayesian inference and my interests for addressing challenges in optics, I work on developing new inference methods and applying them to some imaging problems such as 3D-2D rigid registration, high dynamic range imaging or phase retrieval in CDI.
